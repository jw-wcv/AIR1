## Node.js App\n\nThe application is simply a starter template of a Node.js app using Express.js. It creates an express server that listens on http://localhost:3000 and responds with 'Hello World!' when the home route ('/') is accessed.\n\nThe `app.js` file contains the main server code. The `package.json` file has metadata about the app, including dependencies (which currently, is just Express.js).
